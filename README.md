# Spotify_Song_Analysis

This project delves into a dataset of Spotify songs to explore and predict factors influencing streaming success. It encapsulates data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning model development.
# Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install necessary Python libraries:
pip install numpy pandas plotly seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn wordcloud networkx
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open Final_Project.ipynb.
# Usage
1. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
2. Modify the paths to datasets if necessary.
3. Adjust hyperparameters or model configurations as needed.
# Technical Approach
• Programming Language: Python 3.x
• Data Analysis Libraries: NumPy, Pandas
• Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
• Natural Language Processing: WordCloud, regex
• Machine Learning Framework: Scikit-learn
• Graph Analysis Library: NetworkX
• Data Source: spotify-2023.csv
# Data Preprocessing
• Cleaning and formatting of datasets to rectify anomalies.
• Encoding categorical variables and transforming features.
Exploratory Data Analysis
• Use of statistical visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
# Feature Engineering
• Development of new features such as artist collaboration metrics and temporal analysis.
• Divided songs into popularity range based on streams.
 
# Machine Learning Models
• Implementation of RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, and KNeighborsRegressor.
• Model evaluation using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error.
# Model Evaluation
• Cross-validation to assess model stability.
• Residual analysis to diagnose model fit.
# Running the Project
To run the project, start from the top of the notebook and execute each cell in order. Adjustments can be made to the parameters or the code to explore different modeling techniques or data insights.
